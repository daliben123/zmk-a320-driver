properties:
    motion-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Motion detection output pin. Triggers an interrupt when motion is detected.

    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Reset pin for the touchpad. Active low.
        Used to reset the device to its default state.

    shutdown-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Shutdown control pin. Active low.
        When pulled low, puts the sensor into a low-power state.

    poll-interval-ms:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 10
      description: |
        Polling interval (in milliseconds) for reading touchpad data.
        Defaults to 10ms.

    scroll-speed-divider:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 2
      description: |
        Divider for scroll mode speed. A higher value reduces scroll speed.

    boost-speed-multiplier:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 2
      description: |
        Multiplier for boost mode speed. Increases cursor movement speed.

    slow-speed-divider:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 2
      description: |
        Divider for slow mode speed. A higher value reduces cursor speed.
