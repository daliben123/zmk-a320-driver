properties:
    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Reset pin for the A320 sensor. Active low.
        Used to reset the device to its default state.

    motion-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Motion detection output pin. Goes high when motion is detected.
        Can be used as an interrupt to wake up the system when movement occurs.

    orientation-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Orientation control pin. Configures the sensor's orientation
        (e.g., normal or inverted).

    shutdown-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Shutdown control pin. Active low.
        When pulled low, puts the sensor into a low-power state.
