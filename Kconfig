      This option enables support for the ZMK touchpad driver,
      compatible with Avago A320 optical motion sensors. The driver
      converts touchpad movements into mouse relative position events
      via the ZMK event system.

      The touchpad communicates over I2C and supports motion detection
      interrupts, scroll mode, boost speed, and slow speed adjustments.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
      module will be called touchpad.

      If unsure, say N.

      Select this option if you have a touchpad (e.g., Avago A320) 
      connected to your system. Requires I2C support in the kernel.
