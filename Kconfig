      This option enables support for the Avago A320 optical touchpad.
      The A320 is an optical motion sensor that can detect movement
      along X and Y axes. It communicates via I2C interface.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
      module will be called a320.

      If unsure, say N.

      Select this option if you have an A320 touchpad connected to
      your system. Requires I2C support in the kernel.
